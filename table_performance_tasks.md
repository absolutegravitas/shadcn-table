# Hybrid Approach: Combining `unstable_cache`, Redis, and IndexedDB

This document outlines the hybrid approach to optimize data loading, filtering, and offline capabilities by combining Next.js's `unstable_cache`, Redis, and IndexedDB. It also includes additional performance improvements and considerations. The goal is to optimize data loading, filtering, and offline capabilities while enhancing the user experience.

---

## **Approach**

### **1. First Page Load**

#### **Step 1: Check `unstable_cache`**
- Use Next.js's `unstable_cache` to check if the data is already cached on the server.
- If it exists, serve the cached data to the client.

#### **Step 2: Fallback to Redis**
- If the data is not in the `unstable_cache`, fetch it from Redis.
- Populate the `unstable_cache` with the fetched data.
- Send the data to the client.

#### **Step 3: Populate IndexedDB**
- On the client side, store the fetched data in IndexedDB for offline access and fast client-side filtering.

---

### **2. Subsequent Page Loads**

#### **Step 1: Check IndexedDB**
- On the client side, check if the data exists in IndexedDB.
- If it does, use it for rendering and filtering.

#### **Step 2: Background Sync with Server**
- While using IndexedDB for immediate rendering, trigger a background fetch to check for updated data from the server:
  - Use `unstable_cache` to fetch the latest data if available.
  - If the cache is stale or missing, fetch from Redis and update both `unstable_cache` and IndexedDB.

---

### **3. Offline Mode**

- If the user is offline:
  - Use IndexedDB exclusively for rendering and filtering.
  - Queue any updates or sync operations to be performed when the user comes back online.

---

## **Additional Performance Improvements**

### **1. Data Chunking and Pagination**
- Fetch and store data incrementally to reduce memory usage and improve load times.

### **2. Delta Updates**
- Fetch only the changes (deltas) from the server during background sync to minimize data transfer.

### **3. Compression**
- Compress data before storing it in IndexedDB or transferring it from Redis to the client.

### **4. IndexedDB Indexing**
- Define indexes for frequently queried fields to optimize search and filtering operations.

### **5. Prefetching**
- Prefetch data that the user is likely to need based on their behavior or navigation patterns.

### **6. Cache Invalidation**
- Implement a robust cache invalidation strategy for `unstable_cache` using timestamps or versioning.

### **7. Concurrency**
- Use Web Workers for background sync and data processing to avoid blocking the main thread.

### **8. Optimized Data Structures**
- Use lightweight and efficient data structures for storing and processing data in IndexedDB.

### **9. Lazy Loading**
- Load only the data required for the current view or operation (e.g., visible rows in a data table).

### **10. Error Handling and Fallbacks**
- Implement robust error handling for all data operations and provide meaningful fallbacks.

---

## **User Experience Enhancements**

### **1. Loading Indicators**
- Show loading indicators or skeleton screens while data is being fetched or synced.

### **2. Offline Notifications**
- Notify users when they are offline and provide feedback on queued updates or sync operations.

### **3. Data Freshness Indicators**
- Display a timestamp or badge to indicate when the data was last updated.

### **4. User-Controlled Sync**
- Allow users to manually trigger a sync operation if they suspect the data is outdated.

## Steps

### 1. Extend Existing Utilities
#### IndexedDB (`indexeddb-data-service.ts`)
- Add methods to handle delta updates for tasks by comparing timestamps or version numbers.
- Implement a method to fetch tasks by filters (e.g., status, priority) using IndexedDB indexes for optimized queries.
- Compress data before storing it in IndexedDB to save space and improve performance.
- Define indexes for frequently queried fields such as `status`, `priority`, and `updatedAt`.

#### Redis (`redis.ts`)
- Add support for delta updates by fetching only changed data since the last sync.
- Implement methods to fetch filtered tasks from Redis using query parameters.
- Compress data before transferring it to the client to reduce bandwidth usage.

#### Unstable Cache (`unstable-cache.ts`)
- Extend the wrapper to integrate with Redis and IndexedDB for seamless data retrieval.
- Add tagging support for cache invalidation using timestamps or versioning.
- Implement a robust cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency.

---

### 2. Service Worker Enhancements
#### `task-processor.worker.ts`
- Add support for background sync with IndexedDB and Redis to keep data up-to-date.
- Implement offline-first logic for task processing, prioritizing IndexedDB when offline.
- Enhance the weighted LRU cache to handle larger datasets by dynamically adjusting cache size.
- Use Web Workers to process data in the background without blocking the main thread.

---

### 3. Data Table Integration
#### Components (`data-table/`)
- Modify data table components to use the hybrid approach for data loading and filtering.
- Add hooks to fetch data from IndexedDB, Redis, or `unstable_cache` based on availability and priority.
- Implement lazy loading to fetch only the data required for the current view or operation (e.g., visible rows in a data table).

#### Hooks (`use-data-table.ts`)
- Update hooks to support offline mode and background sync by prioritizing data sources (e.g., IndexedDB > Redis > `unstable_cache`).
- Add logic to prefetch data based on user behavior or navigation patterns.
- Implement robust error handling and fallbacks for all data operations.

---

### 4. UX Enhancements
#### Loading Indicators
- Add loading spinners for data fetch operations.
  - Use TailwindCSS's `animate-spin` class for consistent styling.
  - Integrate spinners into the `data-table` components, particularly during data fetches triggered by pagination, filtering, or sorting.
  - Ensure spinners are accessible by adding appropriate ARIA roles and labels.

#### Offline Notifications
- Display a persistent banner or toast when the application detects offline status.
  - Use the `navigator.onLine` API to monitor connectivity changes.
  - Implement a `useNetworkStatus` hook to centralize offline detection logic.
  - Use Shadcn's toast component for notifications, styled with TailwindCSS.
  - Provide a retry button in the toast for failed operations, linked to the data-fetching logic.

#### Data Freshness Indicators
- Show timestamps for the last successful data sync.
  - Add a `lastSync` state to the `use-data-table` hook.
  - Update the timestamp whenever data is fetched successfully from any source (IndexedDB, Redis, or `unstable_cache`).
- Highlight stale data with visual cues.
  - Use a subtle background color change (e.g., `bg-yellow-100`) for rows with stale data.
  - Add a tooltip explaining the staleness, e.g., "Data may be outdated. Last synced: [timestamp]."
